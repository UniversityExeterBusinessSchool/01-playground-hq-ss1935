# My Structure - Student 05

## What I See in My Data
The code provided included 2 variables, horizontal (h) and vertical (v), how it should be structured and what should the structure be colored.

## What I Think This Means
The provided code intended us to creates an L-shaped structure

## What This Could Be
probably a frame for a children's slider or a rollercoaster structure segment

## Questions I Have
The L-shape is too vague, needed more info to elaborate what was the purpose behind this structure creation.
